## Phase 0 — Pipeline + desktop app bootstrap (pre-2026-06-01)

**Context:** Ingest personal media (Google Takeout/Drive) and load it into Immich, safely.
**Decisions:** Bash + Python pipeline (`scripts/00`–`12`) for system checks, metadata stitching
(`exiftool`), de-duplication (`czkawka` → move to `media_trash`, never delete), and Immich loading;
a Flutter desktop app to drive it dry-run-first. Strong CI (shellcheck, shfmt, ruff, pytest,
flutter analyze/test/build, actionlint) and safety review rules.
**Pivots:** None recorded.
**Outcome:** Working, safety-first media pipeline with a desktop driver.

## Phase 1 — Company standards adoption (2026-06-01)

**Context:** Adopt company reusable-standards (company-os #13, Phase 3).
**Decisions:** Add AI-instruction files (CLAUDE/GEMINI/AGENTS) carrying the ported safety policy
(dry-run-first, never-delete, Immich storage separation); writing/history standards; pre-commit
(shellcheck/markdownlint/gitleaks/ruff/commit-msg); gitleaks CLI; pin CI actions to SHAs; replace
CodeRabbit with an in-house **Cody** PR review (no Dalton — no data layer). Not a Python package,
so no uv migration.
**Pivots:** Review tooling — CodeRabbit → company pr-review (safety rules ported, not lost).
**Outcome:** Repo aligned with company-os standards; safety model preserved.

## Phase 2 — company-os onboarding (2026-06-02)

**Context:** Formally bring the repository under company-os governance.
**Decisions:** Added `.company/` project context and aligned repo with company-wide operating standards.
**Outcome:** Repo is officially registered and governed by company-os.

## Phase 3 — Guided pipeline run (2026-07-12)

**Context:** Manually kicking off and reviewing ~7 separate steps for a single "clean and
import" run was the top pipeline-usability complaint (#48). Every step, including the fully
safe ones (system check, dependency setup, metadata stitching, duplicate scan, dry-run
report, cleanup verification, Immich sync), required its own manual trigger.
**Decisions:** Added a "guided run" consolidated mode alongside the existing per-step manual
mode (not replacing it). `pipeline_models.dart` defines `guidedRunStepIds` (the chain: system
check → dependency setup → rclone config → metadata stitch → duplicate scan → dedup dry-run →
cleanup verify → Immich sync) and `guidedRunCheckpointStepIds` (`delete-dry-run`,
`sync-immich`), with `buildGuidedRunSteps()`/`buildGuidedRunSegments()` resolving and
segmenting the chain — throwing if a confirm-gated step is ever included, as defense in
depth. `pipeline_runner.dart` adds `GuidedRunController`, which runs one segment at a time,
stops immediately on any step failure, and refuses to execute a `PipelineRisk.confirmRequired`
step under any circumstance. The guided run therefore always stops before
`06_delete_duplicates.sh --confirm` and before an Immich rescan — those remain explicit,
separate, human-triggered actions via the unchanged manual step list. The Flutter UI adds a
"Guided Run" control card ahead of the per-step list, sharing the same `StepRunState`/log
plumbing as manual runs.
**Pivots:** None — the two real decision points named in #48 map directly onto
`guidedRunCheckpointStepIds`, so no design change was needed mid-implementation.
**Outcome:** Guided run reduces a full clean-and-import pass to two manual checkpoints
(dedup delete confirmation, Immich rescan trigger) instead of ~7 separate manual triggers,
while the confirm-gate safety invariant (`PipelineRisk.confirmRequired` steps always require
a separate explicit human action) is unchanged and covered by new automated tests.
